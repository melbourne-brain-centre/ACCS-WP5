ACCS Work Package 5 \(Biomedical Imaging Collections and Analysis\)
=================================================================

**Australian Characterisation Commons at Scale \(ACCS\)** is a collaborative project that is developing, deploying and supporting environments for researchers who use imaging techniques, including the neuroscience community. Specifically, Project **Work Package 5 \(WP5\)** aims to develop improved environments for scientists who use imaging techniques, including providing access to Neuroimaging data collections in a more effective way. As part of WP5, we would like to develop and provide multi-node data collection procedures and examples to researchers.  

It is proposed, a proof-of-concept \(PoC\) will be developed that includes end-to-end data flow of naming convention, de-identified T1-weighted images from at least 2 ABIRD nodes to a target AIS-XNAT centralised or federated data repository, move data from targeted AIS-XNAT data repository to CVL site, mirror ABIRD data collection geographically across multiple CVL sites, make data accessible to users, and manage their access using HPCs.
